# In Windows they start with a drive letter (e.g. C:) or two backslashes (e.g. \\servername) 
# In summary, RStudio projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:
#   
# -Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.
# 
# -Keep data files there; we’ll talk about loading them into R in data import.
# 
# -Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.
# 
# -Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.
# 
# -Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.
# 
# Everything you need is in one place, and cleanly separated from all the other projects that you are working on.
